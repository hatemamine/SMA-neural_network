# impact-Of-Image-Colourspace-On-deep-learning-Convolution-Neural-Networks-Performance
this is the material used for my master thesis entitled deep learning for image classification in different color space
conducted under the supervision of Mr prof CHENINE Abdelkader , at University of Ibn Khaldoun Tiaret
The aime of this thesis is tho show if the color space used to specified the value of color in the pixel (e.g RGB where the color is a 3 chanel  a mixteur of the primary color red gren and bleu) 
in image in the dataset has impact over the performence of a deep learning model in image classification 
for the purpose of evaluating the model training with each color space RGB , HSV, LUV, LAB, YUV we have modified a base code 
of resnet https://keras.io/examples/cifar10_cnn_capsule/ and capsulnet https://keras.io/examples/cifar10_cnn_capsule/ , 
also build a GUI to display and load model early trained and saved to predect in a testimage or externe image
